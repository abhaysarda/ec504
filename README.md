# Adv. Data Structures and Algorithms Project on LSH and KD-trees

This project involves developing and testing LSH and KD-tree implementations from literature and popular applications.

The problem that we are seeking to apply this to is applying the same to weather data to forecast power outages. The corresponding data files and final implementation(yet to be started) are in their respectively named folders.



#Running the code yourself

The final project is inside the Final Implementation folder. There are three parts to the project: data analysis, Locality Sensitive Hashing and KD-trees

#Data Analysis
The Data Analysis folder takes in 8 years of data from Michigan and analyzes it. The final data is outputted as a csv file.

#Locality Sensitive Hashing
The two different LSH implementations can be run from the jupyter notebooks

#KD-trees
The two different KD-tree implementations are in two separate folder. Simply run the jupyter notebooks.

As long as you have anaconda installed, the notebooks should run perfectly!

#Accuracy
kNN: 92.18%
LSH: 95.6%
KD-trees: 89%
