# Adv. Data Structures and Algorithms Project on LSH and KD-trees

This project involves developing and testing LSH and KD-tree implementations from literature and popular applications.

The problem that we are seeking to apply this to is applying the same to weather data to forecast power outages. The corresponding data files and final implementation(yet to be started) are in their respectively named folders.
