# Adv. Data Structures and Algorithms Project on LSH and KD-trees

This project involves developing and testing LSH and KD-tree implementations from literature and popular applications.

The problem that we are seeking to apply this to is applying the same to weather data to forecast power outages. The corresponding data files and final implementation(yet to be started) are in their respectively named folders.


## Main Code:
#### Locality Sensitive Hashing
The LSH implementations are located inside "LSH/Main Implementations" folder.

The cosine distance implementation of LSH is called "LSH cosine.ipynb".

The range based implementation of LSH is called "LSH Bins.ipynb".

Open both of the files with jupyter notebook to run the code.
