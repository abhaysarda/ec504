Adv. Data Structures and Algorithms Project on LSH and KD-trees

Using the LSH_minhash_Jaccard_Shruthi.py to find percentage similarity between two documents:

Variables a,b,c are used to store the contents of the documents. The contents can be changed/updated. Run 
#python3 LSH_minhash_Jaccard_Shruthi.py 

The output will be a percentage measure of the similarity between each pair of documents.

For the sample sentences a = "Who was the first king of Poland"
b = "Who was the first ruler of Poland"
c = "Who was the last pharaoh of Egypt",

the output would look as follows-
0.7450980392156863 0.29411764705882354 0.3333333333333333

This indicates the higher measure of similarity between sentences a and b as compared to (a,c) and (b,c).
